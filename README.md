# Project Overview
In this project I was given a web-based application from Udacity that reads RSS feeds. The tests are added using Jasmine to check the code functionality.

## How to run this application.

# How will I complete this project?

Review the Feed Reader Testing [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3442558598/rubric)


5. Explore the Jasmine spec file in **./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js** and review the [Jasmine documentation](http://jasmine.github.io).


13. Write a test suite named `"Initial Entries"`.
14. Write a test that ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container.
15. Write a test suite named `"New Feed Selection"`.
16. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes.
17. No test should be dependent on the results of another.
18. Callbacks should be used to ensure that feeds are loaded before they are tested.
19. Implement error handling for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access.
